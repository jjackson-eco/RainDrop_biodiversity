# RainDrop_biodiversity

This research site is the accompaniment of analyses on the impact of drought on biodiversity in a temperate calcareous grassland. We report on findings of the RainDrop Drought-Net experiment in the Upper Seeds meadow of the Wytham site in Oxford, UK. Please refer to the project site [here](https://jjackson-eco.github.io/RainDrop_biodiversity/) for full information. This is a [workflowr][] project.
